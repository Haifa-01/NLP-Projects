# README: Building an NLP Pipeline

## Lab Overview

This project, **"Lab 2: Building an NLP Pipeline,"** demonstrates the essential steps for preprocessing tweets for sentiment analysis. Using Python's **NLTK** library, the lab walks through data preprocessing, text representation, and sentiment analysis techniques to establish a pipeline for natural language processing tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
1. Load and explore a Twitter dataset.
2. Perform essential text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
3. Represent text data using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** techniques.

## Steps in the Lab

### 1. **Dataset Loading and Exploration**
   - Load a pre-annotated Twitter dataset available within NLTK.
   - Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

### 2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenize text into individual words.
   - Remove stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant symbols (specific to Twitter, such as mentions and hashtags).
   - Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms.

### 3. **Text Representation**
   - Implement the **Bag of Words** approach to represent text numerically.
   - Apply **TF-IDF** to measure the importance of terms within the dataset.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this lab is a pre-annotated Twitter dataset included in NLTK. It is manually labeled and designed to serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis models.

Features of the dataset:
- Text of tweets.
- Sentiment annotations (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

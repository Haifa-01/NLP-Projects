## Learning Goals

This lab involves analyzing approximately 6,000 "best books" fetched and parsed from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). These books were selected based on a proprietary formula used by Goodreads. The goal of this lab is to clean, enhance, and analyze the data to uncover insights about popular books and genres.

By the end of this lab, you will learn how to:
- Load data into pandas and systematically address missing values, including removing observations with missing data.
- Parse columns in a dataframe to create new features or subcategories.
- Group and analyze data to uncover meaningful insights about popular genres, authors, and trends.

## Steps in the Lab

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Loading data from a CSV file.
   - Addressing missing or inconsistent data.

### 2. **Parsing and Enhancing Data**
   - Extracting key features such as genres, ratings, and author details.
   - Structuring and completing the dataframe for analysis.

### 3. **Grouping and Aggregation**
   - Using pandas for group-based operations to summarize trends.
   - Answering data-driven questions, such as identifying the most popular genres or authors.

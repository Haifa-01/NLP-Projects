# README: Dialogue Summarization with Generative AI

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Dialogue Summarization**, using Generative AI models to condense conversations into concise and meaningful summaries. By leveraging prompt engineering and experimenting with various inference approaches, this lab showcases how generative models can be tailored to effectively summarize dialogues.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
1. Understand the concept and applications of dialogue summarization.
2. Explore how input structure and prompt design influence model outputs.
3. Compare **zero-shot**, **one-shot**, and **few-shot** inference techniques for summarization tasks.
4. Develop foundational skills in **prompt engineering** for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Structure

### 1. **Introduction to Dialogue Summarization**
   - Overview of dialogue summarization and its real-world applications.
   - Key goals: capturing the essence of conversations and presenting key points concisely.

### 2. **Types of Summarization**
   - **Extractive Summarization**: Extracts important sentences or phrases directly from the conversation.
   - **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates a summary using rephrased sentences and novel text.

### 3. **Generative AI and Dialogue Summarization**
   - Utilize pre-trained generative models to summarize dialogues.
   - Experiment with different prompting strategies to guide the model towards desired outputs.

### 4. **Prompt Engineering and Inference Techniques**
   - **Zero-Shot Inference**: Directly generate summaries without prior context.
   - **One-Shot Inference**: Provide a single example to guide the model.
   - **Few-Shot Inference**: Supply multiple examples to improve accuracy and contextual understanding.

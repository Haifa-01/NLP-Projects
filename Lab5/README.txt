# README: Advanced Topic Modeling in Python

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive exploration of **Topic Modeling**, a key technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to uncover hidden thematic structures in text data. Through hands-on notebooks, it covers foundational and cutting-edge techniques, along with robust evaluation methods to ensure meaningful insights. 

The project is structured into three key modules:
1. **Introduction to Topic Modeling**: Build a solid understanding of topic modeling concepts and workflows.
2. **Dynamic Topic Modeling with BERTopic**: Leverage BERTopic for interpretable, dynamic topic analysis and visualization.
3. **Evaluation of Topic Models**: Quantitatively assess topic model quality using coherence scores and other metrics.

1. Master the theoretical underpinnings of topic modeling and its applications.
2. Implement both classical (LDA) and modern (BERTopic) topic modeling techniques.
3. Develop skills to evaluate, interpret, and visualize the results of topic models for actionable insights.

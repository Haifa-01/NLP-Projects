## Lab 2: Building an NLP Pipeline

- **Objective**: Build a sentiment analysis pipeline for tweets.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
  - Text representation: Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.
- **Dataset**:
  - A pre-annotated Twitter dataset with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).

## Data-Centric vs Model-Centric Approaches

- **Objective**: Compare the effectiveness of data-centric and model-centric approaches.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Data cleaning, re-labeling, and balancing.
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Output**:
  - A sentiment classifier for product reviews.
